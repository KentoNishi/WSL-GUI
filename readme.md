## About
###
This project relies heavily on Xming. Xming is installed at ``C:\WSL-GUI\``, instead of the default Windows path.
### What is Xming?
> Xming is the leading X Window System Server for Microsoft Windows 8/7/Vista/XP (+ server 2012/2008/2003). It is fully featured, small and fast, simple to install and because it is standalone native Microsoft Windows, easily made portable (not needing a machine-specific installation).

Xming can be downloaded separately [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/).

## Issues
* There is no uninstaller. Files must be removed manually.
